<h2>About me</h2>

<p>
Welcome to my home on the internet. I'll be posting sporadically about whatever interests me. Generally that'll be more STEM oriented, but I imagine once I get more used to this whole blogging thing, I'll branch out. For now the posts are mainly about Math, Algorithms, Optimization, Statistics, Sampling, etc.

<p>
Enjoy the site and please feel free to <a href="mailto:aaron@niskin.org">email me</a> if you come across any issues, typos, mistakes, etc. or if you just feel like talking with me. I've migrated this blog a few times, so there might be whole sections that are not rendering.
