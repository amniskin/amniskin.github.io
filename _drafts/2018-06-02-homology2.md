# Homology

## What is it?

First, let's talk about the pre-requisites. If you don't already know what a Simplicial Complex is, check out my previous post, [homology pt 1]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-04-12-homology %}) because this post will build off of that.

Great! Now let's talk about Homology. There is a natural notion of equivalence of topological spaces called homotopy, but this definition is very hard to work with in high dimensions. So, the field of Homological Algebra was created (by Henri Poincar&eacute; and, of course, Emmy Noether -- not together, but they were both very influential in the creation).

Topology is essentially the study of proximity, which is a close analogue for shape. The specifics of how that's done are not really the point of this post. That's all for this section.

Let's just get right into it, yeah?!

### Associations

But it would be useful to triangulate the torus using the more traditional approach. To get you started on the right track, you'll need another tool: association. An association is basically a way of considering things to be equal. It's kinda like defining specific teleportation or something. I think it's best to just work out an example. So let's triangulate some things (like a sphere -- the air-filled balloon, for example) but without using the fact that we're in 3-D space and using associations instead. Let's start with two 2-simplices joined at one edge (to make something that looks like a square).

![sphere]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pics/2018/04/12_triangulate_base.png)

We then make the following association: we say anything along the line $(\langle1\rangle,\langle2\rangle)$ is associated with things on the line $(\langle4\rangle,\langle3\rangle)$ -- where order is important. If we want to make it more formal, we could parameterize the line connecting $\langle1\rangle$ to $\langle2\rangle$ by a parameter $t$ such that $f_0(0) = \langle1\rangle$ and $f_0(1) = \langle2\rangle$. We describe this visually like so:

![tube]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pics/2018/04/12_tube.png)

We're considering all the points on the top line to be associated with (or equal to) their corresponding points on the bottom line. You can imagine this to be kinda like pacman: when you go off the top edge, you come back from the bottom edge in the same direction (because of the association that we've made). So, we might as well fold the paper over and tape the two sides together so as to better visualize the association we've made. But when we do that, we notice we have a tube!

So the association shown above can be described as a tube. Unfortunately, it's not a simplicial complex though. This can be seen because if we call the top-left triangle $A$, and the bottom-right one $B$, the intersection of $A$ and $B$ is the diagonal line $(\langle1\rangle,\langle3\rangle)$ and the associated line (it's only one because the two are associated -- hence the same line) $(\langle1\rangle,\langle2\rangle) = (\langle4\rangle,\langle3\rangle)$. So the intersection is two lines, which is a simplicial complex, but not a simplex! So this triangulation doesn't have the second property that we require all simplicial complexes to have.

We could make it a simplicial complex by dividing the thing into a 9 square grid (so 18 triangles) and then doing the same thing again with the top being associated with the bottom, but it's a lot to write out. Try it out though. See if you can make it a simplicial complex. If you run into any issues, feel free to email me.

Moving on... Now if we just flipped the association, we get a m&ouml;bius strip!

It might be useful to actually break out a piece of paper and do this if you've never done it before.

If we take the tube and add this one association it becomes a torus (a hollow doughnut)!

If you're trying it out on paper, make sure you label the points so you can see them! If you reverse the direction of the second association, you get something very different -- a Klein bottle!

![klein bottle]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pics/2018/04/12_klein.png)

I feel like it's probably a bit cruel of me to have put this after the picture, in case you've been trying to make the last one with your paper... It turns out, you can't make the last one in 3D space. You need to either use an extra dimension or tear the paper, unfortunately. But, it's interesting to see that flipping the association completely changes the thing -- kinda like chirality in chemistry.

Like if we take the m&ouml;bius strip and make the following additional association, you get something called the Projective Plane (\\(\mathbb{P}^2\\) -- also not embeddable in 3D space).

![projective plane]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pics/2018/04/12_projective.png)


We then say that any point on the boundary (the points on the lines $(\langle1\rangle,\langle2\rangle), (\langle2\rangle,\langle3\rangle), (\langle3\rangle,\langle4\rangle), (\langle4\rangle,\langle1\rangle)$) are all the same. So no longer directional, but rather contracting all the points on the boundary. So all the points on the lines are the same. In order to visualize that, imagine having a flat square piece of a plastic bag on your table with the same points labeled. So the piece of plastic looks like this:

![sphere]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pics/2018/04/12_sphere.png)

Then, since all the points on the top line (and the bottom, left, and right lines) are all associated, imagine contracting them while keeping the inside of the bag relatively unchanged (as far as area is concerned). So necessarily the bag will puff up like a bubble as the sides squish down to a smaller and smaller hole. Eventually, the edge becomes just a point, and what do we have? Yup, we've got a sphere. So that's one way we can triangulate a sphere.

The problem is that none of these are simplicial complexes. Why not? Can you fix these so that they become simplicial complexes?

## Summary

So we've triangulated some things, defined what simplices and simplicial complexes are, but we haven't yet found their utility. For that, just stay tuned! In the next episode we'll go over Betti Numbers and how to compute them using these simplicial complexes!
