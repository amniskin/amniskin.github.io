## Intro

As we all know, on October 7<sup>th</sup> Palestinians broke through the border,
massacred over 1,200 civilians, and kidnapped somewhere between 240 and 254
more.  Israel's response to this barbary set records for minimizing the civilian
to combatant kill ratio in urban warfare[^civ_comb][^henryjackson], and yet has seen no end of
criticism.

[^henryjackson]: See <https://henryjacksonsociety.org/publications/questionable-counting/>

One of the main complications of this war is that there is no clear delineation
between civilian and combattant.  Hamas and friends use human shields and they
intentionally dress like civilians, but it's deeper than that.  Most Palestinian
civilians support the efforts to kill Israelis[^polls], often in a military
capacity.

Al-Aqsa Flood is just the first time, and there will be a second, a third, a
fourth. Because we have the determination[...] to fight.

Ahmad Aljamal was a model citizen who worked as a doctor for a free clinic in
Nuseirat during the day and went home to his son, daughter-in-law,
grandchildren, and 3 Israeli hostages at night[^hostage_takers].  He was not an
official member of any known terrorist organization.

Ayat al-Akhras was a 17 year old girl who blew herself up along with as many
Israeli civilians as she could.

This situation is untenable and something needs to change.  The Israeli
government must do something[^milton_quote], and coexistence is not the answer.

[^milton_quote]: "Government has three primary functions. It should provide for military defense of the nation. It should enforce contracts between individuals. It should protect citizens from crimes against themselves or their property. When government in pursuit of good intentions tries to rearrange the economy, legislate morality, or help special interests, the cost come in inefficiency, lack of motivation, and loss of freedom. Government should be a referee, not an active player." -- Milton Friedman

## It's (un)necessarily evil
It's not like we can just wave a wand and stop the Palestinians from being and
supporting terrorists.  Peaceful coexistence with a society of Palestinians will
require Israel to do some truly evil and orwellian stuff for security.

### Coerced peace is oppression
Given the widespread support of terrorism[^polls], Israel's first job will be to
identify terrorists and their supporters from the population.  Israeli soldiers
will run checkpoints, search private property, and so on, to classify
Palestinians as "terrorist" or not.

It's not just the checkpoints and invasion of privacy, but private property
itself could be rightfully restricted (e.g. weapons, materials to build
explosives, or even construction material to prevent terrorist infra).

All of these things can be thought of as classification
problems[^imbalanced_classes], and every classification problem has type 1 and
type 2 errors.  A false positive is a wrongfully detained Palestinian or an
unnecessarily restricted good, but false negatives result in more civilians
killed.  We should expect a preference for type 1 errors, meaning more
oppression than might be strictly necessary.

[^imbalanced_classes]: This classification problem also suffers from [imbalanced classes](https://machinelearningmastery.com/what-is-imbalanced-classification/) because there are far more Palestinians who support terrorism than those who don't.  We should expect learned bigotry because of this, even though that's not a good thing, nor is it a useful thing.  It's just a likely human outcome.

Israel would have to run a military occupation of a hostile people.  This will
be a **coerced peace**, and therefore an oppressive one.  This is obviously not
a sustainable solution, especially not in a democracy, so this coexistence plan
hinges on **de-radicalization**.

### De-radicalization is Orwellian
Israel will need to re-engineer this society to not have such a high prevalence
of terrorism.  To understand just how orwellian this would be, we need to first
understand how deeply the ideals of terrorism and martyrdom are woven into the
Palestinian identity.

Hamas is more popular than your local football team and the massacre on October
7<sup>th</sup> has a higher approval rating than FDR had during his presidency
(a record setting 72%[^polls] in the polls).  It's hard to see a clear picture
from statistics like that, so let's dig in and paint a picture.

#### Terrorism is central to Palestinian identity

Terrorism is a major industry in the Palestinian territories.  There are dozens
of functioning terrorist organizations[^tals_post] that operate throughout
Palestinian society.  Jihadis are a part of all levels of government, schools,
and mosques.  They have terrorist training camps in every neighborhood.  The
heads of the top terrorist groups meet in Gaza once a year to coordinate
efforts.  Terrorism is a "legitimate" vocation in Palestinian culture.

Palestinian parents drop their kids off at @UNRWA schools that teach dying as a
shahid as a goal to be achieved[^martyrdom].  The schools don't even try to hide
the rockets aimed at Israeli civilians, which works to embed the idea of
terrorism deeper into the Palestinian identity for the students.

The Palestinian Authority maintains a "martyr's fund" with a roughly $300M
budget that pays for Palestinians to break the law in Israel[^martyrs_fund].
Prisoners get paid anywhere from a few hundred dollars a month for petty crime
(spending money for young terrorists) to a few thousand a month for serious
crimes[^memri_pa_martyrs_fund].  Families of "martyrs" are paid high wages and
an additional $200 per month per child.

It's not just the institutions; it's the people too.  A small pizza shop in
Hawara (Judea) ran an ad with a picture of a Holocaust survivor holding up a
peace sign as she's taken hostage by Palestinians on October 7<sup>th</sup>.
The owner posted the ad on instagram as a joke.

We've all seen the images of Palestinians celebrating on October 7<sup>th</sup>
(and probably the celebrations on twitter and tiktok too), but that's just the
start.  Palestinians celebrate terrorist attacks in general.

You might say "yeah, but Israel is doing some bad stuff to them", and that's
a valid point, but why is it that Palestinians celebrated 9/11 en masse[^snopes]
but Colombians didn't?  The DEA has done far more damage in Colombia
(specifically in 90s) than we've ever done to Palestinians even in the worst
light.  Palestinians really do see every one of the 2,996 people killed on
September 11<sup>th</sup> as righteous deaths in Jihad (including the
hijackers).

[^snopes]: Snopes, <https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/false-footaging/>

The Palestinian identity is deeply coupled with terrorism.

#### The point
De-radicalization is about rewriting the Palestinian identity and completely
destroying and subsequently rebuilding their society.  All of their social
structures are wrapped up in terrorism and would have to be replaced by Israeli
approved versions.

As if that wasn't bad enough, the worst part is that we have no idea how to
actually do this.  The U.S. tried something similar in Iraq and failed
miserably.  Israel has tried coexistence many times and it's only lead to what
we have now, so clearly Israel hasn't been successful either.  There's really no
reason to think this will work at all.

## It won't work
The Israeli "occupation" of Gaza from 2006-2023 (which didn't even exist) was
enough to motivate October 7.  Cranking that up to a real occupation will
radicalize them faster than you can de-radicalize them.  Israeli schools will
try to teach peace and tolerance while Palestinian parents teach their kids that
Israelis have always been oppressors.  The kids will pass through Israeli
checkpoints and draw their own conclusions.

So after all this, if we're lucky, we'll end up where we were on October
6<sup>th</sup>, just several thousand fewer, and with more dirt on our hands.

## Conclusion
At some point, people forget who started it and both sides become assholes.
We need a realistic plan for a long-term durable peace, not a feckless PR stunt
that's more likely to make things worse.  We need to stop trying to coexist and
start assessing and socializing realistic options.

There are examples of successfully de-radicalized Palestinians, however.  The
President of El Salvador @nayibbukele's parents were Palestinian refugees and he
shows no signs of reverence for terrorism, in fact he's vocally anti-Hamas.
There is a light at the end of this tunnel, we just need to find it.
