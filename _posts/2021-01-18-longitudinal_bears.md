## The scenario

> You're standing on the surface of the earth (as opposed to whatever your usual hangouts are), and walk a mile south, a mile east, and then a mile north. You see a bear. What color is the bear?

You've heard this one before, but just in case, the answer is: <span class=hint>White. He's at the north pole and it was a polar bear</span>. But that's not the only point that it could be. The riddle is, can you describe the solutions?

## Solution

Pick any line of longitude where the length of the line is $1/n$ miles long, then go a mile north of that and you have a solution. In fact, this set is dense around the ring with circumference of 1 mile.
