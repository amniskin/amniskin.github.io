<h3 id="the-structure-of-these-posts">The structure of these posts</h3>

<p>This post is not really building off of the theory from my previous post (<a href="/mathematics/2018/04/12/homology.html">homology pt 1</a>), but itâ€™s about the same subject. It turns out we were using a book I didnâ€™t really like too much, so I switched to something with a bit more of a familiar style for me. So Iâ€™ll be using <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Topology-Classic-Classics-Advanced-Mathematics/dp/0134689518/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1533510847&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=topology+munkres">Topology by Munkres</a> for these posts (at least for now).</p>

<p>Iâ€™ll not be covering the book in much detail because after all, Munkres did a great job at doing that himself. But I will summarize some things that I feel like summarizing, and do some of the exercises (just the ones I feel like doing because, well, I can â€“ I know, this is sounding more useful by the second).</p>

<p>So letâ€™s dig in!</p>

<h1 id="part-ii">Part II</h1>

<p>But where did part I go? Thatâ€™s not Algebraic Topology, so weâ€™re not gonna cover that part (at least not until I feel like I need a review).</p>

<h2 id="chapter-9-the-fundamental-group">Chapter 9: The Fundamental Group</h2>

<p>Basically, we say $f_0,f_1:X\to Y$ are <strong>homotopic</strong> if there is a continuous function $F:X\times I\to Y$ (where $I=[0,1]$) with the following two properties:</p>

<ol>
  <li>$\forall x\in X, F(x,0) = f_0(x)$</li>
  <li>$\forall x\in X, F(x,1) = f_1(x)$</li>
</ol>

<p>Basically, at one end of the interval $I$ $F$ is $f_0$ and on the other end $F$ is $f_1$. Since the whole map is continuous, this must be a continuous deformation. And thereâ€™s a bunch of (helpful) book-keeping to prove that homotopy defines an equivalence relation, etc. but we wonâ€™t be covering that right now. But before we move on, letâ€™s talk about path homotopyâ€¦</p>

<p>We say the paths $f_0,f_1:I\to Y$ are <strong>path homotopic</strong> if they have the same start and end points ($x_0$ and $x_1$) and there is a homotopy $F$ from $f_0$ to $f_1$ with the following two additional requirements:</p>

<ol>
  <li>$\forall s\in I, F(0,s) = x_0$</li>
  <li>$\forall s\in I, F(1,s) = x_1$</li>
</ol>

<p>One thing to note: if you consider a torus (because who doesnâ€™t love donuts), any two non-intersecting paths will be homotopic, but not necessarily path homotopic because they might go around different sides of the donut hole, for instance. The requirement that the end-points are fixed is no trivial thing.</p>

<p>Letâ€™s get into the questions!</p>

<h2 id="exercises">Exercises</h2>

<h3 id="show-that-if-hhxto-y-are-homotopic-and-kkyto-z-are-also-homotopic-then-kcirc-h-and-kcirc-h-are-homotopic">Show that if $h,hâ€™:X\to Y$ are homotopic and $k,kâ€™:Y\to Z$ are also homotopic, then $k\circ h$ and $kâ€™\circ hâ€™$ are homotopic.</h3>

<div class="hint">

  <p>Let $H,K$ be homotopies from $h$ to $hâ€™$ and $k$ to $kâ€™$ respectively. Then consider the map $G:X\times I\to Z$ defined by $G(x,i) = K(H(x,i),i)$.</p>

  <p><em>Claim</em>: $G$ is a homotopy between $k\circ h$ and $kâ€™\circ hâ€™$.</p>

  <p><em>Proof</em>: $G$ is obviously continuous (because $H$ and $K$ are), so we only have to prove that $G(x,0) = k\circ h$ and $G(x,1)= kâ€™\circ hâ€™$. But those follow directly from the definition of $G$.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="given-spaces-x-and-y-let-xy-be-the-set-of-homotopy-classes-of-maps-from-x-to-y">Given spaces $X$ and $Y$, let $[X,Y]$ be the set of homotopy classes of maps from $X$ to $Y$.</h3>

<p>a) Show that for any $X$, $[X,I]$ is a singleton.</p>

<div class="hint">
  <p>Let $f,g:X\to I$ be continuous maps. Then since $\forall x \in X$, $f(x),g(x)\in[0,1]$, we know that the following map $H:X\times I\to I$ will always be well defined: $H(x,t) = t\cdot f(x) + (1-t)\cdot g(x)$. $H$ is a homotopy.</p>
</div>

<p>b) Show that if $Y$ is path connected, the set $[I,Y]$ is a singleton.</p>

<div class="hint">
  <p>Let $Y$ be path connected and let $f:I\to Y$ be continuous. Pick a point $y_o\in Y$ and define $g:I\to Y$ such that $\forall t\in I$, $g(t)=y_0$. We will prove that $f$ is homotopic to $g$ (and hence all maps are), and conclude that $[I,Y]$ is a singleton. Weâ€™ll prove this in two steps: first weâ€™ll show that $f$ is homotopic to the constant map that maps all of $I$ to one of the end-points of $f$; then weâ€™ll show that the aforementioned constant map is homotopic to $g$.</p>

  <p>To prove the first part, let $h:I\to Y$ be such that $\forall t\in I$, $h(t)=f(0)$. Let $H:I\times I\to Y$ be such that $H(s,t) = f(s\cdot (1-t))$. Then clearly $H$ is a homotopy between $f$ and $h$.</p>

  <p>To prove the second part, since $Y$ is path connected, let $p:I\to Y$ be a path from $f(0)$ to $y_0$. Then let $G:I\times I\to Y$ be such that $G(s,t) = p(t)$. Aaaannnnndddd, thatâ€™s our homotopy between the two constant maps.</p>

  <p>So our desired homotopy from $f$ to $g$ is $G\circ H$.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="a-space-x-is-contractible-if-the-identity-map-i_xxto-x-is-homotopic-to-a-constant-map-nullhomotopic">A space X is <strong>contractible</strong> if the identity map $i_x:X\to X$ is homotopic to a constant map (<strong>nullhomotopic</strong>).</h3>

<p>a) Show that $I,\mathbb{R}$ are contractible.</p>

<div class="hint">
  <p>To show that $I$ is contractible, we can just consider it a corollary of the first part of the previous answer. So weâ€™ll prove the second part (that $\mathbb{R}$ is contractible).</p>

  <p>Let $i:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ be the identity and let $x_0\in\mathbb{R}$, and $f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ with $f(x) = x_0$. Our job is to show that there is a homotopy $F:\mathbb{R}\times I\to\mathbb{R}$ between $f$ and $i$.</p>

  <p>Consider the map $F(x,t)=\begin{cases} x &amp; | x | &lt; t \\\ \text{sign}(x)t &amp; \text{otherwise}\end{cases}$. That is our homotopy.</p>
</div>

<p>b) Show that a contractible space is path connected.</p>

<div class="hint">
  <p>Let $Y$ be contractible and let $y_0,y_1$ be points. Then let $f:I\to Y$ be the constant map $f(t) = y_1$, and let $F:I\times I\to Y$ be the map contracting $i_Y$ to $f$. Then let $p(t) = F(t,t)$. $p$ is a path connecting $y_0$ and $y_1$. Weâ€™re done here.</p>
</div>

<p>c) Show that if $Y$ is contractible, then for any $X$ the set $[X,Y]$ is a singleton.</p>

<div class="hint">
  <p>The proof is very similar to the last two, so Iâ€™m not gonna do it. Ah, the pleasures of self-learning. But basically, contractions have inverses (because theyâ€™re homotopies too!).</p>
</div>

<p>d) Show that if $X$ is contractible and $Y$ is path connected then $[X,Y]$ is a singleton.</p>

<div class="hint">
  <p>The proof that $[I,Y]$ is a singleton is general enough to accommodate this (mutatis mutandis, obvs). Laziness ENGAGE!</p>
</div>

<p>Weâ€™ve done so many exercises I donâ€™t even feel like I need to workout anymore! (These jokes arenâ€™t really free if you consider the toll they take on you).</p>
