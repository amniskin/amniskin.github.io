I"„<p>This post is really several riddles that get progressively more difficult. So donâ€™t be dissuaded if you find the first few too easy (or if you donâ€™t).</p>

<h2 id="baby-crazy">Baby crazy</h2>

<p>Letâ€™s say we know a person named Pat who has two kids and at least one is a boy. Assuming that across the population the probability of having a boy is 50%. What is the probability that the other kid is a boy as well?</p>

<div class="hint">
  <p>Itâ€™s 1/3 (or $33.\bar3$%). To see this, letâ€™s just work out the possible states (the following states will be written as younger,older):</p>
  <ul>
    <li>B,B</li>
    <li>B,G</li>
    <li>G,B</li>
    <li>G,G</li>
  </ul>

  <p>But since we know G,G is not a possibility (because Pat has at least one boy), and only one of the other three have the other child being a boy.</p>

  <p>This might be easier to see and believe if you consider this using coin flips.</p>

<p>Whatâ€™s the probability for an arbitrary probability $p$ of having a boy?</p>

<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
<div class="hint">
  <p>We have the same states as before, but letâ€™s first define some things to help us out:</p>

  <p>\[
\begin{align}
	BG=&amp; \mathbb{P}(\text{boy})\cdot \mathbb{P}(\text{girl}) &amp; GB=&amp; \mathbb{P}(\text{girl})\cdot \mathbb{P}(\text{boy}) &amp; BB=&amp;\mathbb{P}(\text{boy})\cdot \mathbb{P}(\text{boy}) \\<br />
	=&amp; p(1-p) &amp; =&amp; (1-p)p &amp; =&amp; p^2
\end{align}
\]</p>

  <p>now the probability is:</p>

  <p>\[
\begin{align}
	\frac{BB}{BG + GB + BB} =&amp; \frac{p^2}{p(1-p) + (1-p)p + p^2} \\<br />
	=&amp;\frac{p}{2(1-p)+p} = \frac{p}{2-p}
\end{align}
\]</p>

  <p>In particular, if $p=0.5$, we get</p>

  <p>\[
\begin{align}
	\frac{p}{2(1-p)+p} = \frac{p}{2-p} =&amp; \frac{0.5}{2-0.5} \\<br />
	\frac{0.5}{1.5} = \frac{1}{3}
\end{align}
\]</p>

  <p>And just because I apparently like(?) making graphsâ€¦
<img src="/assets/images/2018/06/24_expPlot.png" alt="percentage plot" /></p>

  <p>In case youâ€™re eager to see the like 5 lines of code that went into making that graph, the notebook can be downloaded <a href="/assets/notebooks/2018/06/24_boys-in-the-hood.ipynb">here</a>.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="what-if-we-know-that-the-older-child-is-a-boy">What if we know that the older child is a boy?</h2>

<div class="hint">
  <p>The whole paradoxical part of the problem goes away once we know the position of the known sex baby. By that I mean that the only possible states are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>G,B</li>
    <li>B,B</li>
  </ul>

  <p>So itâ€™s 50/50.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="what-if-i-told-you-that-pat-has-2-kids-and-one-is-a-boy-born-in-summer">What if I told you that Pat has 2 kids, and one is a boy born in summer?</h2>

<div class="hint">
  <p>This is where it gets a little tricky. The states are now:</p>

  <p>far too many to list. But, basically, itâ€™s</p>

  <p>\[
B\cdot{1 \text{ seasons}}, G\cdot{4 \text{ seasons}} \\<br />
G\cdot{4 \text{ seasons}}, B\cdot{1 \text{ seasons}} \\<br />
B\cdot{3 \text{ seasons}}, B\cdot{1 \text{ seasons}} \\<br />
B\cdot{1 \text{ seasons}}, B\cdot{4 \text{ seasons}}
\]</p>

  <p>Note that weâ€™re not double counting the case where both are boys born in summer.</p>

  <p>So there are a total of 15 possible outcomes, and 7 of them have a boy as the second child. So itâ€™s \(\frac{7}{15}\).</p>
</div>

<h2 id="what-if-we-only-know-that-one-child-is-a-boy-born-on-december-23rd">What if we only know that one child is a boy born on December 23rd?</h2>

<p>Or we could consider something a bit more general with probability \(q\).</p>

<h3 id="solution-1">Solution</h3>

<div class="hint">

  <p>Weâ€™re still assuming the probability of having a boy is $p$.</p>

  <p>Then we can describe our exact table above like so:</p>

  <p>\[
\begin{align}
	\mathbb{P}(B\cdot{1 \text{ seasons}}, G\cdot{4 \text{ seasons}}) =&amp; pq(1-p) &amp; =&amp; pq(1-p) \\<br />
	\mathbb{P}(G\cdot{4 \text{ seasons}}, B\cdot{1 \text{ seasons}}) =&amp; (1-p)pq &amp; =&amp; pq(1-p) \\<br />
	\mathbb{P}(B\cdot{3 \text{ seasons}}, B\cdot{1 \text{ seasons}}) =&amp; p(1-q)pq &amp; =&amp; p^2q(1-q) \\<br />
	\mathbb{P}(B\cdot{1 \text{ seasons}}, B\cdot{4 \text{ seasons}}) =&amp; pqp &amp; =&amp; p^2q
\end{align}
\]</p>

  <p>So we have:</p>

  <p>\[
\begin{align}
	\mathbb{P} =&amp; \frac{p^2q(1-q) + p^2q}{p^2q+p^2q(1-q) + 2pq(1-p)} \\<br />
	=&amp; \frac{pq\left(p(1-q) + p\right)}{pq\left(p+p(1-q)+2(1-p)\right)} \\<br />
	=&amp; \frac{p(1-q) + p}{p+p(1-q)+2(1-p)} \\<br />
	=&amp; \frac{p(2-q)}{2-pq}
\end{align}
\]</p>

  <p>And we can see, as \(q\to0\), \(\mathbb{P}\to p\), and as \(q\to1\), \(\mathbb{P}\to \frac{p}{2-p}\)</p>

  <p>The closest thing I can give toward intuition here is this: letâ€™s take the boy-in-summer example, and assume thereâ€™s a 25% chance of being born in summer. Then our universe of possibilities is restricting the known child to 1/4 of the possibilities otherwise, but there is no such restriction on the other child. So in that way, itâ€™s in a sense down-weighting the effect of the known child (by scaling up all of the other possibilities).</p>
