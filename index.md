Welcome to my home on the internet. I'll be posting sporadically about whatever interests me. Generally that'll be more STEM oriented, but I imagine once I get more used to this whole blogging thing, I'll branch out. For now the posts are mainly about Math, Algorithms, Optimization, Statistics, Sampling, etc.

Enjoy the site and please feel free to [email me](mailto:aaron@niskin.org), if you come across any issues, typos, mistakes, etc. or if you just feel like talking with me. I'm always up to chattin with new people.
